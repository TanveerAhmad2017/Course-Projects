## Data Center Profit Management

### Intro
- CS773 course project, 2014 Fall

### Objective
- Design and implement offline algorithm to management profit in data center

### Overview of this project
- We implement the offline optimal algorithm using LINGO solver
- We implement two heuristic algorithms FirstFit and BestFit
- We evaluat the running time of optimal offline algorithm (OPT) under different settings
- We evaluate the performance of heuristic algorithms FirstFit and BestFit against OPT
