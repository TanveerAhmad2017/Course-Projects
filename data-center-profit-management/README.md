## Data Center Profit Management

### Intro
- CS773 course project, 2014 Fall

### Objective
- Design and implement offline optimal algorithm to management profit in data center
- Implement classical heuristic algorithms to study their performance in maximizing profit.

### Overview of this project
- We implement the offline optimal algorithm (OPT) using LINGO solver
- We implement two heuristic algorithms FirstFit and BestFit
- We evaluate the running time of optimal offline algorithm (OPT) under different settings
- We evaluate the performance of heuristic algorithms FirstFit and BestFit against OPT
